  # Team Profile Generator

  # Description
  This was challenge 12 for the Trillogy Skills Bootcamp. The aim of this challenege was to use classes and test driven development to create a team profile generator. This chanllenge was very hard for me to grasp. I rreally enjoyed the use of tests to ensure all the classes worked correctly. Moreover, the use of the 'main menu' to create as many ememployees as the user wants was very difficult as well. Overall I learned a lot from this assignment, especially the order in which writing code is most efficient. A great learning experience

  ## Installation

  For this project you must use npm i to install all the relevant packages. Further, you must have access to node.js on your machine


  ## Usage

  To use simply navigate to the terminal in VS code. Next, navigate to the directory with index.js using cd "relative path of the directory". Next write node index.js and answer the prompts for the manager. After you have finished describing the manager you will be asked if you want to include another manager, add an engineer, add an intern or finish. Keep adding employees and answering the prompts for as many employees as you would like. Finally, when you are done, simply use your arrow keys to select finish. A new html file will be created in the "output" folder. Open the team.html file in your browser and voila! Your team is displayed!
